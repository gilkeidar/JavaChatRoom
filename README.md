# Java Chatroom
Console chat room developed in Java. Uses sockets, multithreading, and a client-server model. Sockets work via port-forwarding.

## Running the chat
There are two programs: ChatServer2.jar and Chat.jar (the client). To set up the chat room, you need to run the ChatServer2.jar
file and to join the chat room you can run the Chat.jar file. The clients have to know the IP of the computer that runs the 
ChatServer2.jar file. You may need to configure your router in order for this to work (since the chat uses port-forwarding).
